  <p>Samoyeds' friendly disposition makes them poor guard dogs; an aggressive Samoyed is rare. The breed is characterized by an alert and happy expression which has earned the nicknames <span>Sammie smile</span> and <span>Smiley dog</span>.</p>

  <p>With their tendency to bark, however, they can be diligent watch dogs, barking whenever something approaches their territory.<br>Samoyeds are excellent companions, especially for small children or even other dogs, and they remain playful into old age.
   When Samoyeds become bored, they may begin to dig. With their sled dog heritage, a Samoyed is not averse to pulling things, and an untrained Samoyed has no problem pulling its owner on a leash rather than walking alongside. Samoyeds were also used
   to herd reindeer. They will instinctively act as herd dogs, and when playing with children, especially, will often attempt to turn and move them in a different direction.</p>

  <p>Samoyeds have a dense, double layer coat. The topcoat contains long, coarse, and straight guard hairs, which appear white but have a hint of silver coloring. This top layer keeps the undercoat relatively clean and free of debris. The under layer, or
   undercoat, consists of a dense, soft, and short fur that keeps the dog warm. The undercoat typically sheds heavily once or twice a year, and this seasonal process is sometimes referred to as <span>blowing coat</span>. This does not mean the Samoyed will shed
   only during that time however; fine hairs (versus the dense clumps shed during seasonal shedding) will be shed all year round, and have a tendency to stick to cloth and float in the air. The standard Samoyed may come in a mixture of biscuit and white
   coloring, although pure white and all biscuit dogs are common. Males typically have larger ruffs than females. While this breed is touted as <span>hypoallergenic</span>, it does shed a fair amount and needs frequent grooming. While the breed may produce less allergens, care should be taken for severe allergies.</p>
